# Section01 - Machine Learning Overview
In this directory, I will be exploring the following topics related to Machine Learning:

## What is Machine Learning?
An introduction to the concept of machine learning.

## Data Preprocessing
The first and one of the most crucial steps in machine learning is data preprocessing. Proper data preprocessing ensures that the data is in the best possible shape for training models.

### Data Preprocessing Using Python
In Python, I will explore the following topics:
- Importing Libraries
- Importing Datasets
- Taking Care of Missing Values
- Encoding Categorical Data
- Splitting the Data into Training and Test Sets
- Feature Scaling
